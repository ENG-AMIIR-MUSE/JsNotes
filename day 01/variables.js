Variables
 Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

 An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
 A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.
 Variables are used to store this information.

 variables are the reference which points to memory location 

A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:


Program : set of instructions that performs some actions 

Process: is the running state of the program or excuting state 
why we require variables 
-----------------------------
so if your program is in the running state , at that time to 
perfom action you need some data   
and to store data in the memory while excuting the program 
, so we can utilize  that data to make some actions 
 you need variables to store that data 


or some times you generate a data after excuting Program , and ou will need to store  that data 

how to create a variable 
to create a variable you have to use it  scope statements  the variable name the   assgiment operator  then the value 

scope statement : 
const  , let , var  

variable syntax : 
const  variableName  = value 

variable declarion :  means just creating  a variable  , inside the ram some box will be created  and the box will have some some address 


*/
// variable declarations 
let name ; 
let age ;

// storing data to the variables / variable assigment
name   = "amir"
age  = 29 ; 

// variable intialization : declating  the variable and storing data at the same time 
let city  =  "mogadhisho"
console.log(`my city is ${city}`)


console.log(`Hello My name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`)
