// here we are printing the details but the third parameters doesn't have any data 
// and if we try to print that it gonna give us undefined 
// so what is undefined   : 
// undefined is special value in javascript   when ever we create a variable or parameter  and if we dont assign any data to that variable javascript is consider that variable is undefined 
//undefined means there's no value assigned for a variable or function
